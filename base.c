/************************************************************************

 This code forms the base of the operating system you will
 build.  It has only the barest rudiments of what you will
 eventually construct; yet it contains the interfaces that
 allow test.c and z502.c to be successfully built together.

 Revision History:

 INTERRUPT_HANDLER
 When the Z502 gets a hardware interrupt, it transfers control to
 this routine in the Operating System.
 NOTE WELL:  Just because the timer or the disk has interrupted, and
         therefore this code is executing, it does NOT mean the 
         action you requested was successful.
         For instance, if you give the timer a NEGATIVE time - it 
         doesn't know what to do.  It can only cause an interrupt
         here with an error.
         If you try to read a sector from a disk but that sector
         hasn't been written to, that disk will interrupt - the
         data isn't valid and it's telling you it was confused.
         YOU MUST READ THE ERROR STATUS ON THE INTERRUPT
